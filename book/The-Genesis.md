# Chapter One: The Genesis

First, there was skiwi, a humble user of Code Review Stack Exchange, and he was looking for a project to tackle with the Spring framework.

He made a chatbot, the *GithubHookSEChatService*.

Then, there was Simon Forsberg, another humble user of Code Review Stack Exchange. He made a chatbot user, and it answered.

-- Please give my bot some rep, - said Simon, and the chatbot user got some rep.

-- Good answer... - answered Vogel, another humble user of Code Review.

Instead of Simon, the chatbot user came.

-- Thank you, - said the user. - And you can call me Duga.
